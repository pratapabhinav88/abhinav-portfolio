# My Portfolio (scaffold)

This is a minimal, colourful, and interactive React portfolio scaffold built with Vite and Framer Motion.

Quick start (Windows cmd.exe):

```
cd "c:\Users\HP\Desktop\React Portfolio"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the displayed `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite shows).

What I included:
- `src/App.jsx` — main layout with header, hero, project grid, about, contact and footer
- `src/components/Hero.jsx` — animated hero with CTA
- `src/components/ProjectCard.jsx` — animated project cards
- `src/data/projects.js` — example project entries and gradients
- `src/styles.css` — colorful theme, gradients, and layout
